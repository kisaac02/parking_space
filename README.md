Mask used to segment/divide image

Using cropped area of large parking lot video

To get more video for training use video concatenated with same video playing backwards

Model is pretrained
Training data available
Training data is small cropped images of parking spaces. Empty or Not Empty

Categories are visually very distinct.
So don't need complex classifier
Classifier very robust. But not state of the art.
